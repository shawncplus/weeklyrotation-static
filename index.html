		<p>As the subtitle suggests, much like a book club. Every week you'll get an email with 3 albums, throughout the week listen to them, ponder them, share them, maybe even buy them. At the end of the week come back and discuss it with the other members in the comments or live in the Google Hangout livestream. It's completely free, this is just to find new music, share the music you love, and chat about it with other music fanatics.</p>
